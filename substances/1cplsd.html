1-Cyclopropionyl-d-lysergic acid diethylamide (also known as 1cP-LSD) is a lesser-known novel psychedelic substance of the lysergamide class. It is structurally related to LSD and other LSD analogs like 1B-LSD, ALD-52, and 1P-LSD. It is suspected to produce its effects by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain; however, its precise mechanism is not known.

The origins of 1cP-LSD are not well-documented. Following 1P-LSD's prohibition in Germany, 1cP-LSD appeared on the online research chemical market in 2019. Like other LSD analogs, it was marketed as a legal alternative to LSD and 1P-LSD.
