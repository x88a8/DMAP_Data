1-Valeroyl-d-lysergic acid diethylamide (also known as 1V-LSD or Valerie) is a novel psychedelic substance of the lysergamide class. 1V-LSD is closely related to LSD and 1P-LSD and is reported to produce near-identical effects. The pharmacology is not known, but it is likely similar to that of LSD, which acts on serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine receptors in the brain.

1V-LSD is a research chemical that appears to have been first synthesized in June or July of 2021. It was announced on the same day following the announcement of the German NpSG ban of 1cP-LSD.
