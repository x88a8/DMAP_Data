3-Methylmethcathinone (also known as 3-MMC or metaphedrone) is a novel stimulant-entactogen substance of the cathinone class. It is a structural analog of mephedrone (4-MMC). The mechanism of action is not fully studied, but dopamine and serotonin releasing activity is thought to be involved.

3-MMC first appeared on the online research chemical market shortly after the banning of the massively popular mephedrone. It is one of many cathinone analogs that were released in the 2010s. It is a prominent example of a contemporary designer drug specifically chosen to mimic and/or replace the functional and structural features of its recently-controlled predecessors.
