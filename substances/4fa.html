4-Fluoroamphetamine (also known as 4-FA, 4-FMP, para-Fluoroamphetamine, PAL-303 and colloquially as Flux) is a novel synthetic amphetamine compound that produces a unique progressive mixture of entactogenic and stimulant effects when administered. It is part of a series of fluorinated amphetamine analog that initially included such compounds as 2-FA, 2-FMA, and 3-FA.

Anecdotal reports have described the subjective effects of 4-FA as having a moderate MDMA-like entactogenic onset for the initial few hours of the experience that then gradually transitions into traditional amphetamine-type stimulation (for a total duration of around 6 to 8 hours) with residual effects that can last a few hours afterward.
